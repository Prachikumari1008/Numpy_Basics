# Numpy
- NumPy stands for numeric python which is a python package for the computation and processing of the multidimensional and single dimensional array elements.
  
- NumPy performs array-oriented computing.
  
- It efficiently implements the multidimensional arrays.
- It performs scientific computations.
- It is capable of performing Fourier Transform and reshaping the data stored in multidimensional arrays.
- NumPy provides the in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.

## What is NumPy Used for?
   NumPy is an important library generally used for:
   
     1. Machine Learning
     
     2. Data Science
     
     3. Image and Signal Processing
     
     4. Scientific Computing
     
     5. Quantum Computing

## Why Use NumPy?
   The major reasons why we should use NumPy are:
   
      1. Faster Execution  
      
      In Python, we use lists to work with arrays. But when it comes to large array operations, Python lists are not optimized enough.

       Numpy arrays are optimized for complex mathematical and statistical operations. Operations on NumPy are up to 50x faster than iterating over native Python lists using loops.

       Here're some of the reasons why NumPy is so fast:

         Uses specialized data structures called numpy arrays.
         
         Created using high-performance languages like C and C++.

      2. Used with Various Libraries

NumPy is heavily used with various libraries like Pandas, Scipy, scikit-learn, etc.
  ## Installation of NumPy
      pip install numpy
      
  ## Import NumPy in Python
      import numpy as np
